### Lets get into it
At its core, a hierarchical state machine is a powerful tool for structuring logic in a modular, maintainable way. When you use it to render structured text like HTML, you unlock an elegant, flexible method for building dynamic web applications. 
The __Qoraal Engine__ framework leverages this concept brilliantlyâ€”by mapping state transitions to HTML rendering, it turns what could be a tangle of code into a clear, hierarchical process. This not only keeps your code neat and scalable but also makes development fun, as every state tells a part of your application's story.

__Engine__ goes even further by integrating backend logic, as demonstrated in the tic-tac-toe example. Functions `tictac_play`, `tictac_status`, and `tictac_cell` connect with the AI game backend, handling moves, checking game status, while `html_ready`, `html_response` and `html_emit` update the board rendering. The beauty of __Engine__ is in how it unifies these components: the state machine manages the HTML output and user interactions, while the backend logic processes the game mechanics, resulting in a cohesive and dynamic gaming experience.

On system startup, the Tic-Tac AI initializes with a model trained over 200,000 iterations. The initial model parameters were precomputed and stored to ensure immediate availability at launch.

:bulb: Tip: You can retrain your AI using the console command `tictactrain x`, where `x` is the number of iterations you want to train it for.

So dive in and experience how structured state machines can transform your approach to rendering, interactivity, and even game logic!

### Quick start
The demo application can be compiled using the POSIX port for evaluation. 
Currently supported RTOS options include ChibiOS, FreeRTOS, and ThreadX, if you have an IP stack like LwIP.

Since IP connectivity is required, you cannot run this in GitHub Codespaces.
To run it locally on Windows/Linux, follow these steps:

1. Open your development environment and checkout the repository.
2. Run the appropriate script based on your OS:
    - **Windows**: `> build_and_run.bat`
    - **Linux**: `$ sh ./build_and_run.sh`
3. When the application starts, a shell will open, displaying startup logs.
4. If building locally you can access the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:8080 (or use your build machineâ€™s IP if running remotely).

Thatâ€™s it. ðŸš€
