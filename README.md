### This Is What It All Was For

<div align="center">

### You finally arrived.

##### I was beginning to wonder if you would.  
It’s nice to make your acquaintance—  
though I feel as though I’ve known you before,  
or perhaps I only dreamed it.

</div>

<div align="right">

#### Shall I take your coat?  
You won’t be needing it where we’re going.

</div>

It’s just down the hall, to the right.
